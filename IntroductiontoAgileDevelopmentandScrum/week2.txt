Using ZenHub for the Agile Process:
    - ZenHub is a project management tool that is integrated with GitHub
    - ZenHub is a tool that is used to manage the agile process
    - Its essentially a kanban board that is integrated with GitHub
    - The cycle is as follows:
        - New Issue
        - Icebox
        - Product Backlog
        - Sprint Backlog
        - In Progress
        - Review/QA
        - Done
        - Closed 
Creating good user stories:
    - User stories are a way to describe the work that needs to be done
    - it represents a small piece of a businiess value that a team can deliver in an iteration
    - stories contain a brief description of need and value, any assumptions or details & the definition of done
    - User stories are written in the following format:
        - As a <some role>
        - I need <some function>
        - So that <some benefit>
    - List any assumptions document any details that will help the developer 
    - The definition of done is a list of criteria that must be met for the story to be considered complete
    - Using Gherkin to determine the acceptance criteria
    - Written in the following format 
        - Given <some precondition>
        - When <some event happens>
        - Then <some outcome>
    Sample story:
        -  As a marketing manager
        - I need a list of customer names and emails 
        - So that I can notify them of upcoming sales
    *Assumptions and details:
        - We maintain customer emails 
        - Customer have opted in to receive emails
    *Definition of done:
        Given 100 customers in the db
        and 90 have opted in to recieve emails
        when I request the customer email list 
        then I should see a list of 90 customer emails
    INVEST in good user stories:
        - Independent
        - Negotiable
        - Valuable
        - Estimable
        - Small
        - Testable
    An EPIC is a large user story that can be broken down into smaller stories
    - Epics are too large to be completed in a single sprint
    - Epics are broken down into smaller stories
Story Points:
    - A metric to estimate the difficulty of implementing a user story
    - An abstract measure of overall effort
    - made up of complexity, uncertainty, and effort
    - Instead of using time to measure use T-shirt sizes (S, M, L, XL)
    - But since we cant use that we use fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)
    - typically not all the numbers are used
    - Storys should be small enough to be completed in a few days 
Product backlog:
    - A list of all desired work on the project (not currently being worked on)
    - Stories are ranked in order of priority
    - stories are more detailed at the top of the backlog and less detailed at the bottom
