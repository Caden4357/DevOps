Cloud Security: 
    - There are different types of shared security models for IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. 
    - In IaaS, the provider looks after the physical security of the infrastructure at their data centers. 
    - IaaS users are responsible for the security of the software including the OS required to run their applications and their data.   
    - In PaaS, the provider secures the platform including the OS, user subscriptions and login credentials, but the user is responsible for the security of any code or data -- or other content -- produced on the platform. 
    - However, in SaaS, the provider is responsible for almost every aspect of security, including underlying infrastructure, service application, and the data the application produces. Users still have some security responsibilities such as protection of login credentials.
Cloud Security pt2: 
    - An organization should consider the following points while building the IBM cloud: Modernize at your own pace, matching your business requirements. Retain your existing investments and on-premises applications, while slowly inducting the right cloud IAM architecture to complement or replace your framework. Establish a zero-trust implementation that will provide a centralized access control, preserve client confidentiality, reduce insider threats, and secure your remote resources. Zero trust model and plan use an environment that securely connects the right users to the right data at the right time under the right conditions, while also protecting your organization from cyber threats. Enable scalability for your cloud IAM for millions of users or transactions without a major modification of the infrastructure.
    - Another element of cloud security is cloud network security which refers to the security measures, technology, policies, controls, and processes used to protect data on public, private, and hybrid cloud networks. There are many security implications when you extend your network to a cloud environment. To meet modern network security requirements, organizations need to deploy and manage network security built directly on the cloud. The benefits of cloud network security are: Centralized security monitoring and management Easy management and updating of granular policies Real-time detection and powerful prevention against intrusions, DDoS, and other web-based attacks Automated configuration and management, helping to eliminate misconfiguration errors, and maintain control over traffic Encryption services to protect data at rest and in transit Centralized protection and management of identity and access 
    - There are some critical steps under three phases that you can follow. First is identifying your cloud usage state and risks. Second is protecting your cloud system, and third is responding to attacks. The first phase comprises: Identifying how your data is accessed Detecting unknown cloud usage Checking your configurations for cloud services Monitoring for signs of malicious usage of cloud data In the second phase, you can protect your cloud system by: Assigning protection policies Encrypting sensitive data Formulating policies for data sharing Restricting data sharing to unknown devices Implementing a bot protection and mitigation solution Using a proper anti-malware solution The third phase offers best practices for responding to attacks and attempts to attack: Add additional authentication and verification steps for high-risk access scenarios Add new policies for new cloud services The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has made a list of best practices and principles that establish a secure and sustainable cloud computing framework. These principles are NIST's five pillars of a cybersecurity framework: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. 
    - Another emerging technology in cloud security that supports cybersecurity framework is cloud security posture management (CSPM). CSPM solutions are designed to address a common error in many cloud environments, that is, misconfigurations. CPSM also addresses issues by helping in the deployment of the core components of cloud security. They include identity and access management (IAM), regulatory compliance management, traffic monitoring, threat response, risk mitigation, and digital asset management.
    - The current major trend in cloud security includes multi-cloud strategies such as cybersecurity mesh, zero-trust security models, hybrid and multi-cloud environment, cloud-native tools and applications, deployment of DevSecOps, securing remote workforces, and AI and machine learning for threat detection. The focus is on privacy and data protection regulations.
Identity and Access Management (IAM): 
    - IAM is a framework of business processes, policies, and technologies that enable organizations to manage digital identities and access to resources. IAM systems provide a secure and efficient way to manage user access across an organization. IAM is a critical component of an organization's security strategy. It is a framework of business processes, policies, and technologies that enable organizations to manage digital identities and access to resources. IAM systems provide a secure and efficient way to manage user access across an organization. IAM is a critical component of an organization's security strategy
    - An access group is a group of users and service IDs created so that the same access can be assigned to all entities within the group with one or more access policies.
    - Access policies define how users, service IDs, and access groups in the account are given permission to access account resources. Policies include: a subject, which can be users, service IDs, or access groups; a target, which is the resource or provisioned service offering, to which you want to provide access; and role, which defines the actions allowed on the target of the policy, that is, the resource to which the access is being granted.
CLoud Encryption:
    - Encryption is defined as scrambling data in a way that makes it illegible. There are two parts to an encryption system, the encryption algorithm and the decryption key. The encryption algorithm defines the rules by which data will be transformed so that it becomes illegible. And the decryption key defines how the encrypted data will be transformed back to legible data. Encryption ensures that only authorized users have access to sensitive data and when accessed or intercepted without authorization, data is unreadable and meaningless. 
    - There are two types of encryption: symmetric and asymmetric. Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. Asymmetric encryption uses two keys, a public key and a private key. The public key is used to encrypt data and the private key is used to decrypt data.
    Cloud providers offer various cloud encryption services, this could be limited encryption of data that is identified as sensitive, or end-to-end encryption of all data uploaded to the cloud. Data is encrypted upon receipt, and encryption keys are passed to the customers to decrypt data when needed. Keys need to be managed securely. If you lose your keys, you will not be able to read your data. Data needs protection in three states: at rest, in transit, and when it is in use. Encryption at rest protects data while it is physically stored in a database or the storage layer. Depending on the application and business requirements, there could be multiple options for encrypting data at rest, such as encryption for block and file storage, built-in encryption, in object storage, and database encryption services. Encryption in transit protects data while it is transmitted from one location to another. Encryption in transit includes encrypting the data before transmission, authenticating endpoints, and decrypting and verifying data on arrival. Secure Sockets Layer or SSL and Transport Layer Security, TLS are commonly used protocols for encryption in transit. They are not only used when accessing websites securely, but also for data moving between servers and services within the cloud. Encryption in use protects data when it is in use in memory for computations. It allows computations to be performed on encrypted text without needing to decrypt the data. Cloud storage encryption could be server-side or client-side. Server-side encryption occurs after Cloud storage receives your data, but before the data is written to disk and stored. For server-side encryption you can either create and manage your own encryption keys, known as customer supplied encryption keys, or you can generate and manage your encryption keys using key management services offered by the cloud storage provider, known as customer managed encryption keys. Client-side encryption occurs before data is sent to Cloud storage. This way, users can utilize encryption keys and algorithms that are not visible to the cloud provider, making it virtually impossible for cloud providers to decrypt hosted data. Given that a majority of enterprises today operate in multi-cloud environments, there is a need to implement a singular data protection strategy across an enterprise on-premise, hybrid, and multi-cloud deployments. Some cloud providers offer multi-cloud data encryption services with a range of features, such as data access management, integrated key management, and sophisticated encryption that combine to deliver the scalability and flexibility to help protect the most sensitive workloads across the enterprise, regardless of where the data resides. Using a multi-cloud data encryption console, you can define and manage access policies, create, rotate, and manage encryption keys, and aggregate access logs. Encryption does not eliminate data security risk, it separates the security risk from the data itself by moving security to the encryption keys. These keys need to be managed and protected against threats in order to keep the data secure. Key management services offered by some cloud providers help perform lifecycle management for encryption keys that are used in cloud services or customer-built applications. They enable customers to encrypt sensitive data at rest and to easily create and manage the entire lifecycle of cryptographic keys that are used to encrypt data. Since the keys remain in possession of the customer, the data is protected from cloud service providers as well as from other users. Some of the best practices for encryption key management include: Storing encryption keys separately from the encrypted data. Taking key backups off site and auditing them regularly. Refreshing the keys periodically. Implementing multi-factor authentication for both the master and recovery keys.
