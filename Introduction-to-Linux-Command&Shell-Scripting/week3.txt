Shell scripting basics:
    - a script is a list of commands that can be ran and interpreted by the shell usually not compiled 
    - slower than compiled languages but easier to write and debug
    - good for automating tasks (ETL jobs, file backups and archives & sys admin tasks)
    - a SHELL script is an executable text file with an interpreter directive aka shebang (#!) at the top of the file
    - the shebang tells the shell which interpreter to use to run the script
    - the shebang is followed by the path to the interpreter (e.g. #!/bin/bash)
